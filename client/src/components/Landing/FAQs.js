              <p>
                Student is supposed to do a literature survey in a particular area of interest (may or may not be tightly coupled to research proposal), and find out at least 5 papers. The selected papers should be regular papers from A*/A/B ranked conferences/journals published in last 10 years. There will be two kinds of evaluation: <br />
                <br />
                (a) WRITTEN COMPREHENSIVE: DC of the student will conduct a written exam based on the papers identified by student/DC. Scope of the written examination will be the content and underneath basics of the papers. The evaluation of the written exam would be done by DC members.
                <br /><br/>
                (b) ORAL COMPREHENSIVE: Student will present these papers in front of department faculty members and doctoral committee members.
<br/>
Doctoral committee will ask questions on basics as well as detail of the research problems
being addressed in the given papers.
<br/>
Based on presentation and viva-voce, doctoral committee would decide marks in the oral
comprehensive examination.
